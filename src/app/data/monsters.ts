		'description': 'Aerial servants are semi-intelligent creatures from the elemental plane of air that often roam the astral and ethereal planes. On those planes they have a vaguely visible form, but when on the material plane they are invisible. They normally are only found on the material plane as a result of being summoned by a cleric and commanded to perform some task, often being required to use their immense strength to carry objects or aid the summoner. They may carry 1,000+ pounds, and have an immense strength which they can use to hold a human-sized or smaller target immobile. To break free, the victim must have a STR of 18, and even then there is only a 50% chance to break away. Victims with STR of 19 or higher may escape with no roll. Aerial servants have keen senses, and are only surprised on 1-4 on a d6. An aerial servant that fails or is thwarted in its mission becomes insane and immediately returns to the caster who summoned it and tries to kill him. '

A stinger always breaks off inside the victim, and if the victim survives the poison he suffers an additional 1 hp of damage per round until the stinger is removed. A bee that successfully strikes dies the following round from the trauma of losing its stinger. A character must spend 1 round to remove a stinger. A queen is guarded by 10 giant killer bees.

		'description': 'Rumors abound of a type of a powerful all-female race of chaotic (and possibly demonic) dragons that spawn all other dragons of chaos or evil bent. A chromatic dragon is 6\' long and has one head type of each of the following dragons: black, blue, green, red, and white. Each head may bite in a round, dealing damage equivalent to that drago\'s bite damage. In addition, each head may deliver the appropriate breath weapon type, one per round, once per day. Each head may cast 2 spells a day of the spell level indicated below: Head Type Spell Level Black 1st level Blue 2nd level Green 3rd level Red 4th level spells White 5th level spells These creatures also attack with a stinger-tipped tail for 1d6 damage. Victims must additionally save versus poison or die. Each of the chromatic drago\'s heads can suffer 16 hp damage before becoming lifeless, but they regenerate in 24 hours. If all heads are destroyed or the body is injured to 0 hp the dragon dies. Chromatic dragons are 90% likely per head color to have one adult dragon of that type present as a companion. Only three known chromatic dragons are thought to be still living, Lahamu, Kishar, and Damgul.'

The eye of the deep is thought to be a distant relative of the eye of terror, for its appearance is that of said creature. Hundreds of small seaweed-like bristles hang from the bottom of its body. Two large crab-like pincers protrude from its body, and two long, thin eyestalks sprout from the top of its orb. Eyes of the deep are typically found only in the deepest parts of the ocean, where they float slowly, searching for prey. They attack using eye rays, and then they grasp an opponent with pincer-like claws and subject victims to a bite attack. Each of the creatur\'s eye stalks can produce a magical ray once per round. The creature can aim both of its eye rays in any direction. The eyes have the following powers: Hold Person: Left eye·the target must succeed on a saving throw versus spells or be affected as though by the spell. An eye of the deep will use this ray early in a fight so as to disable its opponents. Hold Monster: Right eye·the target must succeed on saving throw versus spells or be affected. This is used in the same manner as the hold person ray. Phantasmal Force: By combining the rays of both eyes, the eye of the deep can replicate the spell phantasmal force.Stun: An eye of the dee\'s centrAL eye can, once per round, produce a cone of stunning energy extending straight ahead from its front to a range of 3\', with a 2\' diameter at the terminAL end.

Those who choose to live under water are often of green hair, eyes and skin, while those above water have purple skin, eyes either purple or cloud gray, and blue-tinted black hair. Both kinds are 22\' tall. Storm giants are the most formidable of all giants. They live in remote locations;about 60% of the time they live on clouds like their cloud giant cousins, and 30% of the time in the mountains like their stone giant relatives. Somewhat more rarely, 10% of the time storm giants choose to live underwater. In all cases, they live in immense, luxurious castles. Like most other giants, storm giants keep guards, and if living above water will have 2d4 griffons. However, storm giants who have their castle abodes under water will instead have giant crabs (3d6 in number). Storm giants have the ability to summon thunderstorms that will arrive after 1 turn. In the presence of a thunderstorm, a storm giant is able to cast a lightning bolt 1 time per 5 rounds. The hit point damage inflicted is equal to the storm giant\'s current hit point total, and a saving throw versus spells can reduce this damage by 50%. Storm giants are immune to all forms of lightning, even the lightning breath attack of blue dragons.'

He is constantly attended by and surrounded with all sorts of slimes and oozes (1d4 of at least 4 types). When confronted, he usually takes the form of a 1\' tall column of bubbling and squirting ooze. This being resembles a red-eyed large bubbling mass of greenish black and foul-smelling liquid. Ooze, slime, and pus constantly squirt and seep from its form. In combat he lashes out with a slimy pseudopod, dealing 4d10 acid damage. Once per 10 rounds he may employ a slime spittle up to 15\' away with a 3\' diameter area of effect that has both the effects of contact with green slime and ochre jelly. Juiblex regenerates 2 hp each round. He may only be affected by +2 weapons or better. Juiblex has the following spell-like abilities, usable at will: cause disease, charm monster, circle of cold (1\' radius, 5d6 cold damage),darkness 1\' radius, detect invisibility, dispel magic, ESP, fear (as the wand of fear), Fly, hold monster, invisibility 1\' radius, locate object, phase door, project image, putrefy food and water, and telekinesis (1,500 lbs.).

In the fall and winter the leaves change to yellow, orange, or red, but they rarely fall out. A treant\'s legs fit together when closed to look like the trunk of a tree, and a motionless treant is nearly indistinguishable from a tree. For this reason, at a distance of more than 30 yards, a motionless treant cannot be distinguished from a normal tree. Because of their inconspicuous nature, beings are surprised on a surprise check roll of 1-3 on 1d6. Treants are very long lived, and as such they take few actions, including speaking, with any haste. They fear fire, and will be cautious if it is nearby. Treants have the ability to control 2 normal trees with a range of 60\'. These animated trees will engage in combat with the same characteristics of a treant, and have movement of 30\' (5\'). Treants may stop or start animating news trees on any given round.'

Vampires must take refuge in a coffin or other hide-away during the daylight hours, and must slumber on soil from their own grave once in a while to maintain their powers\' vitality. Vampires are immensely strong, and deal great blows that inflict 1d10 hit points of damage. These blows (or any other touch) further reduce the victim\'s life energy by two levels, which consequently reduces all other traits linked to a loss in levels (attack ability, hit dice, etc.). Vampires have the innate ability to take gaseous form at will, but will be forced into this form if their hit points reach zero. They then attempt to reach their coffin to reform their bodies. If they do not reach the coffin within 2 turns and rest for 8 hours, they are unable to reform. Further, vampires have the innate ability to shape change into a large bat at will, which grants them flying movement. They can summon 1d10x10 bats or rats when underground. They can summon 3d6 wolves or 2d4 dire wolves when above. These creatures will arrive in 2d6 rounds. In addition, a vampire has a charm gaze (as the charm person spell) that takes effect if a victim peers into a vampire\'s eyes. The victim may attempt a saving throw versus spells with a penalty of -2. Although these items do not actually cause harm or completely repel these creatures, vampires will draw back from a lawful holy symbol, a mirror, or garlic if they are presented with confidence. Garlic causes a vampire to cringe for 1d4 rounds, and a holy symbol or mirror will cause a vampire to take a position in which the item does not impede his or her progress or attack. A lawful holy symbol will affect a vampire no matter what its ethos was in life. Once a person becomes a vampire, he or she is a chaotic undead creature, and holy water will inflict 1d6+1 hit points of damage. There are a few means by which a vampire may be destroyed. They take great damage from immersion in running water, and will be killed in 1 turn. In addition, if caught in sunlight a vampire must succeed in a saving throw versus death for each round exposed, or it will be completely turned to dust. Finally, a stake through the heart, coupled with decapitation, will destroy a vampire. Holy sacraments (such as wafers) must be placed in the mouth. Note that if a vampire is staked he or she will appear to die, but unless also decapitated the vampire will revive when the stake is removed. Vampires create others of their kind by draining humans or other humanoids of all life energy (they reach 0 level). The victim must be buried, and after 1 day he will arise as a vampire. The victim will retain abilities, including class abilities, which he had in life but will become a chaotic undead being.

		'description': 'Wraiths are incorporeal undead creatures born of evil and darkness. In some cases, the grim silhouette of a wraith might appear armored or outfitted with weapons. This appearance does not affect the creature\'s AC or combat abilities, but only reflects the shape it had in life. Like other undead, wraiths are unaffected by sleep, hold, or charm spells. They are unharmed by non-magical weapons. Although silver weapons do damage to them, these only deal half damage. When a wraith touches a victim it inflicts 1d6 hit points of damage and drains one level or hit die. Note that characters drained of levels must also reduce other characteristics associated with their class and level. After being drained of levels, a character will have the minimum number of experience points for the level he is reduced to. Should a character reach level 0, he dies and will become a wraith in 24 hours. The new wraith is under the command of the wraith that killed him.'

Xorns are able to blend in their environment, and can surprise opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. Xorns do not attack fleshly beings except to defend themselves or their property, since they cannot digest meat. Xorns are indifferent to creatures of the material plane·with the sole exception of anyone carrying a significant amount of precious metals or minerals, which xorns eat. They can smell food up to 20\' away, and may ask adventurers to give them their precious metals. If refused, they will almost always (90%) attack to take it forcefully. Xorns are completely immune to fire or cold-based attacks. They suffer only half damage from electrical-based attacks, or no damage with a successful saving throw. The spells rock to mud and stone to flesh reduce a xorn to AC 8 for 1 round, and the xorn cannot attack as it transforms back to its original form. The spell move earthpushes a xorn backwards 30\' and stuns it for 1 round. A xorn can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal after 1 round of preparation. A phase door spell cast on an area containing a burrowing xorn kills it instantly. '

Each such animated object then immediately attacks whomever or whatever the caster initially designates. An animated object can be of any non-magical material. This spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature. This spell requires considerable interpretation by the Labyrinth Lord. Animated objects can move in a manner logical to their shape, whether this is a slithering rope, a walking chair, a rolling vial, or a shuffling chest. Movement should range from 10\' to a maximum of 120\'. For example, a chair might move at the full possible movement, but something awkward and without legs, like a chest, might only move at 10\'. Objects attack using the same required attack value roll as the caster. Attack frequency and damage will depend on available weapons and the size of the animated object. The number of attacks should range from 1 per 5 rounds to 1 per 1 round, at the Labyrinth Lord\'s discretion. Damage will be 1d6, unless variable weapon damage is used, in which case damage should range from 1d4 to 5d4 depending on the object type and size.

The caster can bring the astral forms of five other willing creatures, provided all subjects are linked in a circle at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the caster and must accompany him at all times. If something happens to the caster during the journey, his companions are stranded. The caster projects his astral self onto the astral plane, leaving the physical body behind on the material plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of the caster, but only items that exist in the astral plane may be taken along. Since the astral plane touches upon other planes, the caster can travel astrally to any of these other planes. To enter one, the caster leaves the astral plane, forming a new physical body on the plane of existence entered. While on the astral plane, the astral body is connected at all times to the physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the caster is killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the body where it rests on the material plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the astral plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the astral plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes. The caster and companions may travel through the astral plane indefinitely. Their bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation.

The mouth cannot utter spells or activate magical effects.

Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. Amagic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, HD, or class except by external garb.

Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Entangled creatures can\'t move, but can break loose depending on their strength. Any being with strength in a human range can break free of the webs in 2d4 turns. Creatures of higher strength or magically augmented strength above 18 can break free in 4 rounds. The strands of a webspell are flammable. All creatures within flaming webs take 1d6 points of fire damage from the flames for 2 rounds. After this time surviving creatures are free of the webs.', edition: 'AE' },
	{ type: 'Magic-User', name: 'Wish', reversible: 'no', level: 9, range: 'Unlimited', duration: 'See below', description: 'Wish is the mightiest spell that can be cast. By simply speaking aloud, the caster can alter reality. This spell can accomplish any effects described for limited wish, and may mimic other 9thlevel spells or create comparable effects. Ultimately, the Labyrinth Lord will have to decide the limits of a wish spell. Events can be reversed; the dead can be brought back to life or an entire army might be healed of damage. An entire group could be teleported to any location with no chance of error. Powers or ability bonuses may be wished for at the Labyrinth Lord\'s discretion, and these might be permanent or temporary. Wishes will be fulfilled according to the letter of the request, and the Labyrinth Lord can exercise some regulation of wishes based on this strict enforcement. Although another character may be wished dead, such an act disrupts balance and the Labyrinth Lord should think of a method to fulfill the wish but in a way that the character wished dead is unaffected. For instance, if a character is wished dead, the caster may be transported through time to a point where the victim has already died of natural causes, or the caster might be sent to an alternate dimension where the victim has died.', edition: 'AE' },
